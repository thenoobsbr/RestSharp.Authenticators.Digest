## 🎯 Code style and conventions

*
Use [C# standard conventions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions)
* Prefer `async/await` over `Task.Result` or `.Wait()`
* Use explicit access modifiers (`public`, `private`, etc.)
* Tests follow the `Given_When_Then` pattern where appropriate

We recommend enabling automatic formatting with:

```bash
dotnet format
```
